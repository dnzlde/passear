# User Location Display Feature

## Overview
**Issue**: добавить на карту отображение местоположения пользователя (Add user location display on map)  
**Enhancement**: В идеале - с направлением движения тоже (Ideally - with direction of movement too)

This feature adds a visual indicator showing the user's current location on the map, along with their direction of movement when available.

## Implementation Details

### Key Components

#### 1. Location Tracking State
Added state variables to track user location and heading:
```dart
LatLng? _userLocation;
double? _userHeading; // Direction user is facing in degrees (0 = North)
StreamSubscription<Position>? _locationSubscription;
```

#### 2. Location Stream
Implemented continuous location tracking using Geolocator:
```dart
void _startLocationTracking() async {
  const locationSettings = LocationSettings(
    accuracy: LocationAccuracy.high,
    distanceFilter: 5, // Update every 5 meters
  );

  _locationSubscription = Geolocator.getPositionStream(
    locationSettings: locationSettings,
  ).listen((Position position) {
    setState(() {
      _userLocation = LatLng(position.latitude, position.longitude);
      _userHeading = position.heading;
    });
  });
}
```

#### 3. User Location Marker
Created a distinctive marker to display the user's position:
- **Outer circle**: Light blue pulsing circle (60x60) at 20% opacity
- **Middle circle**: Blue circle (40x40) at 30% opacity with white border
- **Inner dot**: Solid blue circle (20x20)
- **Direction arrow**: White navigation icon that rotates based on heading

#### 4. Resource Cleanup
Properly disposes of the location stream when the widget is destroyed:
```dart
@override
void dispose() {
  _locationSubscription?.cancel();
  super.dispose();
}
```

## Features

### ✅ Real-time Location Updates
- Continuously tracks user's position
- Updates every 5 meters of movement
- High accuracy GPS tracking

### ✅ Direction Indicator
- Shows user's heading/direction when available
- Navigation arrow rotates to indicate facing direction
- Requires device with compass/heading support

### ✅ Visual Design
- Layered circular design for clear visibility
- Blue color scheme that stands out from POI markers
- Semi-transparent outer circles for subtle presence
- Always visible on top of POI markers

## User Experience

### What Users See
1. **Blue dot**: Clearly indicates "you are here"
2. **Direction arrow**: Shows which way you're facing/moving (when available)
3. **Pulsing circles**: Creates a radar-like effect for better visibility

### Permissions Required
- Location services must be enabled
- App requires location permission (requested automatically)
- Works with both foreground location access

## Technical Notes

### Compatibility
- Works on both iOS and Android
- Heading/direction requires device with compass
- Falls back gracefully if heading unavailable

### Performance
- Efficient: Only updates when movement exceeds 5 meters
- Minimal battery impact with optimized location settings
- Stream properly cleaned up on widget disposal

### Integration with Existing Features
- Does not interfere with POI markers
- Works alongside map rotation and zoom
- Compatible with "Center to my location" button

## Testing

Created integration test in `test/integration/user_location_test.dart`:
- Verifies location tracking initialization
- Ensures no crashes during startup
- Validates UI elements are present

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Animation for the outer circle (pulsing effect)
- Accuracy circle showing GPS precision
- Trail showing recent movement path
- Option to toggle location marker in settings
