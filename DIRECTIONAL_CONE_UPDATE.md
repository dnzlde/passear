# Google Maps-Style Directional Indicator - Update

## Overview

Based on user feedback, the user location marker has been updated to show the phone's direction similar to Google Maps, using a directional cone/beam instead of a small arrow.

## New Visual Design

### With Heading/Direction (Compass Available)

                 ◉  ← User location dot
              (Blue center)
```

### Detailed Structure

When heading is available, the marker shows:

1. **Directional Cone** (Blue, 30% opacity)
   - Cone shape pointing in direction user is facing
   - 90-degree spread angle (45° on each side)
   - Length: 48px (80% of marker size)
   - Semi-transparent blue fill
   - Subtle blue border for definition

2. **User Location Dot** (Center)
   - Blue circle (20px diameter)
   - White border (3px thick)
   - Small white center dot (8px)

### Without Heading (No Compass)

Falls back to simple circular marker:
- Outer circle (60×60): Light blue @ 20% opacity
- Middle circle (40×40): Blue @ 30% with white border
- Inner dot (20×20): Solid blue

## Google Maps Style Features

✅ **Directional Cone**: Shows which way you're facing like a beam of light  
✅ **Rotates smoothly**: Follows device compass orientation  
✅ **Clear visibility**: Much more obvious than small arrow  
✅ **Native look**: Uses CustomPaint for smooth graphics  
✅ **Familiar UX**: Similar to Google Maps user location indicator  

## Technical Implementation

### Custom Painter
The cone is drawn using a CustomPainter class:

```dart
class _DirectionalConePainter extends CustomPainter {
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    // Creates cone shape pointing upward
    // Rotated by Transform.rotate based on heading
    // 90-degree cone angle (45° each side)
    // Arc at the top for smooth appearance
  }
}
```

### Marker Widget
```dart
Widget _buildUserLocationMarker() {
  if (_userHeading != null && _userHeading! >= 0) {
    return Transform.rotate(
      angle: _userHeading! * 3.14159 / 180,
      child: Stack([
        CustomPaint(painter: _DirectionalConePainter()),
        // Blue dot with white border
        // White center dot
      ]),
    );
  }
  // Fallback to circular marker
}
```

## User Experience

### What Users See

1. **Standing still** or **no compass**: Simple blue circle
2. **Moving with compass**: Blue cone pointing in direction they're facing
3. **Turning**: Cone rotates smoothly to show new direction
4. **Walking**: Cone points forward, showing where they're going

### Advantages Over Previous Design

| Feature | Old (Arrow) | New (Cone) |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Visibility | Small arrow, hard to see | Large cone, very clear |
| Direction clarity | Arrow icon inside dot | Full directional beam |
| Google Maps similarity | Different design | Same style |
| Visual impact | Subtle | Prominent |
| Size | 16px icon | 48px cone |

## Behavior

- **Rotation**: Entire cone rotates based on device heading (0° = North)
- **Updates**: Real-time as device orientation changes
- **Smoothness**: Native canvas painting for fluid rendering
- **Fallback**: If no heading available, shows simple circular marker

## Code Changes

**File**: `lib/map/map_page.dart`  
**Commit**: `75b7e41`

**Changes**:
- Refactored `_buildUserLocationMarker()` to show cone when heading available
- Added `_DirectionalConePainter` class for custom cone drawing
- Improved center dot design with white border and center
- Maintained fallback to circular marker when no heading

## Testing

To test the new directional indicator:

1. **Run on device with compass** (most physical devices)
2. **Grant location permissions**
3. **Rotate the device** - Cone should rotate smoothly
4. **Walk around** - Cone should point in direction you're moving
5. **Compare** - Should look similar to Google Maps user location

## Visual Comparison with Google Maps

### Google Maps
```
User location shows as:
- Blue dot in center
- Blue cone/beam pointing forward
- Rotates with device orientation
```

### Passear (Now)
```
User location shows as:
- Blue dot in center ✓
- Blue cone/beam pointing forward ✓
- Rotates with device orientation ✓
```

**Result**: Now matches Google Maps style! 🎉

**Note**: This update addresses the user's request to make the phone's direction visible similar to Google Maps.
