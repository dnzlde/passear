# Test Execution Guide

## Before: Tests Failed with Network Errors

```
❌ flutter test
Running tests...
Failed: HTTP 400 - Network requests blocked in test environment
WikipediaPoiService.fetchNearbyPois() throws exception
```

## After: Tests Pass with Mock Implementation

### Running Individual Tests

```bash
# Test the mock API client directly
flutter test test/services/api_client_test.dart

# Test Wikipedia service with mocking
flutter test test/services/wikipedia_poi_service_test.dart

# Test widget with mock support
flutter test test/widget_test.dart
```

### Expected Test Output

```
✅ MockApiClient returns configured responses
✅ MockApiClient provides default Wikipedia responses  
✅ MockApiClient throws exceptions for unknown URLs
✅ WikipediaPoiService works with mock client
✅ PoiService fetches POIs without network calls
✅ Widget tests load without network errors
```

### Test Coverage

The implementation covers:
- [x] Mock API client basic functionality
- [x] Wikipedia API response mocking (geosearch)  
- [x] Wikipedia API response mocking (extracts)
- [x] Service layer integration with mocks
- [x] Error handling and fallbacks
- [x] Widget testing compatibility

### Production Behavior (Unchanged)

```dart
// Production code continues to work exactly the same
final poiService = PoiService(); // Uses real HTTP client
final pois = await poiService.fetchNearby(32.0741, 34.7924);
// Makes real API calls to Wikipedia
```

### Test Behavior (Now Mocked)

```dart
// Tests use mock implementation
final mockClient = MockApiClient();
final poiService = PoiService(apiClient: mockClient);
final pois = await poiService.fetchNearby(32.0741, 34.7924);
// Returns mock data, no network calls
```

## Key Benefits Achieved

🚀 **Fast**: Tests run in milliseconds instead of seconds  
🎯 **Reliable**: No dependency on external APIs or network  
🔒 **Isolated**: Tests are deterministic and repeatable  
✅ **Compatible**: Follows Flutter testing best practices  
📦 **Minimal**: Only 3 files changed in existing codebase  

The solution completely addresses the original problem where Flutter's test environment was blocking network requests with 400 status codes.
