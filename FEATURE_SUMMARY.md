# Feature Summary: Pedestrian Routing and Navigation

## Overview

This feature adds comprehensive pedestrian routing and turn-by-turn navigation to the Passear app, enabling users to navigate to Points of Interest or custom locations with visual and voice guidance.

## What Was Added

### 1. Core Routing Service (`lib/services/routing_service.dart`)
- **OpenRouteService Integration**: Uses OpenRouteService API for professional pedestrian routing
- **Fallback Routing**: Provides straight-line routes when API is unavailable (offline mode)
- **Route Calculation**: Computes distance, duration, and waypoints
- **Smart Interpolation**: Creates smooth route visualization with interpolated points

### 2. Navigation Models (`lib/models/route.dart`)
- **NavigationRoute**: Stores complete route data including waypoints, distance, duration, and instructions
- **RouteInstruction**: Individual turn-by-turn instruction with distance and location
- **Human-Readable Formatting**: Automatic formatting of distances and durations

### 3. UI Components

#### Map Display
- **Route Polyline**: Blue line showing the walking route
- **Destination Marker**: Red pin marking the destination
- **Route Summary Card**: Top card showing distance, time, and stop button
- **Navigation Instruction Card**: Bottom card showing current turn instruction with icon and progress

#### Interaction Features
- **Navigate Button**: Added to POI detail sheets
- **Long-Press Navigation**: Long-press anywhere on map to set custom destination
- **Stop Navigation**: Close button to cancel active navigation

### 4. Voice Guidance
- **Route Summary Announcement**: Announces distance and time when route starts
- **Approaching Instructions**: Announces turns when within 50 meters
- **Immediate Actions**: Repeats instruction when within 20 meters
- **Arrival Notification**: Announces when destination is reached

### 5. Navigation Logic
- **Real-Time Progress**: Updates every 5 meters based on GPS location
- **Automatic Instruction Advancement**: Moves to next instruction as user progresses
- **Map Auto-Fit**: Automatically zooms to show entire route

## Usage Flow

### Navigate to POI
1. User taps POI marker on map
2. POI detail sheet opens with description
3. User taps "Navigate" button
4. Route is calculated and displayed
5. Voice guidance announces route summary
6. User follows turn-by-turn instructions

### Navigate to Custom Location
1. User long-presses on map at desired location
2. Confirmation dialog appears with coordinates
3. User confirms navigation
4. Route is calculated and displayed
5. Navigation proceeds as above

### During Navigation
- Map shows blue route line and red destination marker
- Top card shows distance remaining and estimated time
- Bottom card shows current turn instruction with icon
- Progress bar shows navigation completion
- Voice announces upcoming turns automatically
- User can stop navigation at any time with close button
