# User Location Feature - Testing & Verification Guide

## Testing Checklist

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites
- [ ] Flutter SDK installed
- [ ] Device/emulator with location services
- [ ] Location permissions granted to the app

### üß™ Manual Testing Steps

#### 1. Initial Load Test
- [ ] Launch the Passear app
- [ ] Grant location permissions when prompted
- [ ] **Expected**: Map should center on your current location
- [ ] **Expected**: Blue circular marker should appear at your location
- [ ] **Expected**: No crashes or errors

#### 2. Location Marker Visibility Test
- [ ] Zoom in and out on the map
- [ ] **Expected**: User location marker stays at 60x60 size
- [ ] **Expected**: Marker remains visible at all zoom levels
- [ ] **Expected**: Marker is on top of POI markers

#### 3. Direction Indicator Test
- [ ] If device has compass: Rotate your device
- [ ] **Expected**: White arrow in the marker rotates with you
- [ ] **Expected**: Arrow points in the direction you're facing
- [ ] If no compass: Only circles should appear (no arrow)

#### 4. Movement Tracking Test
- [ ] Walk/move at least 5 meters
- [ ] **Expected**: Marker position updates to follow you
- [ ] Continue moving around
- [ ] **Expected**: Marker continues tracking your position

#### 5. Map Interaction Test
- [ ] Pan the map away from your location
- [ ] Tap "Center to my location" button (blue location icon)
- [ ] **Expected**: Map centers back on your location marker
- [ ] Rotate the map using two fingers
- [ ] **Expected**: User location marker maintains correct position

#### 6. POI Interaction Test
- [ ] Tap on a POI marker (not your location)
- [ ] **Expected**: POI details sheet opens
- [ ] **Expected**: Your location marker still visible in background
- [ ] Close the POI sheet
- [ ] **Expected**: User location marker unchanged

#### 7. Performance Test
- [ ] Use the app for 5-10 minutes
- [ ] Move around different areas
- [ ] **Expected**: No lag or stuttering
- [ ] **Expected**: Battery usage is reasonable
- [ ] **Expected**: Location updates smoothly

#### 8. Cleanup Test
- [ ] Close/kill the app
- [ ] Check device location settings
- [ ] **Expected**: No orphaned location tracking
- [ ] Reopen the app
- [ ] **Expected**: Location tracking starts fresh

### üêõ Common Issues to Check

#### Issue: Location marker doesn't appear
- **Check**: Location permissions granted?
- **Check**: Location services enabled on device?
- **Check**: GPS signal available? (try going outside)

#### Issue: No direction arrow
- **Note**: This is normal if device has no compass
- **Check**: Some emulators don't support heading data
- **Try**: Use a real device with compass support

#### Issue: Marker position is inaccurate
- **Check**: GPS signal strength (walls/buildings can block)
- **Try**: Go outside for better GPS accuracy
- **Wait**: GPS accuracy improves after a few seconds

#### Issue: Marker doesn't update when moving
- **Check**: You've moved at least 5 meters (update threshold)
- **Check**: Location services still enabled
- **Try**: Force stop and restart the app

### üì± Device-Specific Testing

#### iOS Devices
- [ ] Test on iOS simulator
- [ ] Test on physical iPhone
- [ ] Verify location permission dialog appears
- [ ] Test with "While Using App" permission

#### Android Devices
- [ ] Test on Android emulator
- [ ] Test on physical Android device
- [ ] Verify location permission dialog appears
- [ ] Test with different Android versions if possible

### üîç Visual Verification

Compare your marker with this description:
- **Outer circle**: Large, light blue, semi-transparent
- **Middle circle**: Medium blue with white border
- **Inner dot**: Small, solid blue
- **Arrow** (if available): White, points forward, rotates with heading

### üìä Expected Behavior Summary

| Action | Expected Result |
|--------|----------------|
| App launch | Marker appears at current location |
| Move 5+ meters | Marker follows your position |
| Rotate device | Arrow rotates (if compass available) |
| Zoom map | Marker stays fixed size |
| Pan map | Marker stays at GPS coordinates |
| Tap POI | Location marker remains visible |
| Close app | Location tracking stops cleanly |

### üéØ Success Criteria

The feature is working correctly if:
1. ‚úÖ Blue marker appears at your location on app launch
2. ‚úÖ Marker updates position as you move
3. ‚úÖ Direction arrow appears and rotates (on supported devices)
4. ‚úÖ No crashes or performance issues
5. ‚úÖ Marker is visually distinct from POI markers
6. ‚úÖ Location tracking stops when app closes

### üöÄ Next Steps After Verification

If all tests pass:
- ‚úÖ Feature is ready for production
- Consider adding to release notes
- Update app store screenshots

If issues found:
- Document specific problems
- Check console logs for errors
- Test on different devices/OS versions

### üìù Build and Run Commands

```bash
# Clean build
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Run on connected device/emulator
flutter run

# Run with verbose logging
flutter run -v

# Build for specific platform
flutter build apk        # Android
flutter build ios        # iOS
flutter build web        # Web
```

### üîß Debugging Tips

Enable location logging:
```dart
// In map_page.dart _startLocationTracking():
_locationSubscription = Geolocator.getPositionStream(
  locationSettings: locationSettings,
).listen((Position position) {
  print('Location update: ${position.latitude}, ${position.longitude}');
  print('Heading: ${position.heading}');
  setState(() {
    _userLocation = LatLng(position.latitude, position.longitude);
    _userHeading = position.heading;
  });
});
```

Check console output for:
- Location permission status
- GPS accuracy
- Position updates frequency
- Any error messages

**Note**: Since this development was done without a Flutter environment, these tests should be performed on an actual device or emulator to fully verify the implementation.
